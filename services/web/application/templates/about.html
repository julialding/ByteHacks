            <p>The Great Depression was a drastic economic catastrophe that took place in the 1930s as a result of a huge
                stock
                market crash, causing several dreadful consequences that resulted in sky-high unemployment rates globally.
                Banks
                failed, investors were wiped out, and over 15 million Americans were left jobless. Those who were able to
                keep
                their job earned a much lower salary, and many descended into debt, resulting in states of absolute poverty.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what if the technology present today was available in that period of history? The search for jobs would
                have
                been so much easier nationwide. Helploy is a website designed to help the economic situation by alleviating
                the
                severity of unemployment. Helploy allows the input of oneâ€™s personal information through their own personal
                account, which contains important information such as location, job desired, previous experience, etc.
                Helploy
                also takes into consideration various discriminatory factors that were prevalent back then, such as gender
                and
                race. Based on all this information, Helploy matches the job-seeker to a job, thereby increasing the chances
                of
                employment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ongoing global pandemic has caused increasing rates of unemployment, resulting in the financial
                instability
                of many households. Not surprisingly, the applications of Helploy are still relevant today.
